Data Analysis on diabetes Data


Main Purpose

Diabetes is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in the United States. It influences millions of Americans each year, making people lose the ability to regulate glucose in the blood. This factor ultimately reduces a person’s quality of life and life expectancy. Thus, it motivates me to explore data to find the most important factor that causes diabetes.


Detail

- This project was done under the guidance of Professor Hwa Jeong Seo at Gachon University in Korea
-	Gained hands-on experience in visualizing and analyzing a diabetes info dataset using Seaborn in a Jupyter Notebook.
-	Developed skills in data visualization techniques to identify patterns and insights
-	Created count plots to illustrate the increasing prevalence of diabetes with age.
-	Developed bar charts to display Logistic Regression coefficients, highlighting significant factors like High Blood Pressure and Cholesterol Checks
-	Used a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier to evaluate the model’s performance, achieving a precision of 0.76 and recall of 0.73.
  
Conclusion
-	People who have high BP and high Chol are likely to have diabetes.
-	People who consume veggies and have high income are less likely to have diabetes.
-	By expanding the size of the dataset, the result of the study can become more accurate.
